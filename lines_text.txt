This module explores various aspects of pneumatic and
electro-pneumatic systems, demonstrating their applications in
automation and control. The first experiment introduces the behavior of a
single-acting cylinder controlled by 32-way valves, showcasing the
difference between Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) valves.
The NC valve allows air flow and extends the cylinder only when pressed,
while the NO valve allows air flow when released, highlighting the
fundamental differences in their control behavior. In the second
experiment, logical circuits are introduced using AND and OR
configurations. These circuits, implemented with pneumatic valves, show
how air flow and cylinder movement can be controlled based on logic
gates. The AND circuit requires both an NC valve to be pressed and an NO
valve to be released for the cylinder to extend, while the OR circuit
allows air flow if either condition is met. This demonstrates the
flexibility of pneumatic control using basic logic functions. The third
experiment focuses on the indirect control of a single-acting cylinder
through roller lever valves. Both right and left roller lever
configurations are explored, with the right valve allowing air flow when
pressed and the left valve doing so when released. This experiment
emphasizes how directional control of the lever influences cylinder
movement and how positioning of the lever plays a critical role in
controlling pneumatic systems. The fourth experiment integrates relays
for electrical control of pneumatic systems, using AND and OR circuits to
govern the extension of the cylinder. By combining push buttons and
relays, this experiment illustrates how electrical signals can be used to
manage pneumatic operations, offering a hybrid solution for automation.
The AND circuit requires both buttons to be pressed for the cylinder to
extend, while the OR circuit activates with either button, providing
flexibility in control. The fifth experiment applies electro-pneumatic
principles to a practical barrier control system with indicator lamps.
Using both single-acting and double-acting cylinders, the system is
controlled by push buttons, with visual feedback provided by LEDs.
